first we fetch the schema and break it into chunks based on the number of tables.

Here, tables contains an array of objects, where each object has a table_name property. For example:


The chunkArray function splits this array into smaller chunks:

akes each chunk of table names
Processes them in parallel using Promise.all
For each table in the chunk:
Fetches column information
Fetches table data
Combines them into a structured object
Adds the results to allTableData.

so for a url,first allthe tables are fetched.
if we have 8 tables and chunk size of 5,then each chunk formed will have 5 tables each and returned

then in each chunk,we iterate over the tables,loop thrig them while parallely fetching the data of each table in rach chunk
Taking an array and a chunk size as parameters
Creating smaller arrays of the specified size
For example, if CHUNK_SIZE = 5 and you have 12 tables:

for chunking the table data
export function chunkTableData(tableData) {
  const CHUNK_SIZE = 4000; // Maximum size for each chunk
  const chunks = [];
  let currentChunk = [];
  let currentSize = 0;
  
  // Helper to estimate the size of a row
  const getRowSize = (row) => JSON.stringify(row).length;
  
  // Process table data row by row
  for (const row of tableData) {
    const rowSize = getRowSize(row);
    
    if (currentSize + rowSize > CHUNK_SIZE) {
      // If adding this row would exceed chunk size:
      if (currentChunk.length > 0) {
        chunks.push(currentChunk);  // Save current chunk
      }
      currentChunk = [row];        // Start new chunk with current row
      currentSize = rowSize;       // Reset size counter
    } else {
      // If row fits in current chunk:
      currentChunk.push(row);      // Add row to chunk
      currentSize += rowSize;      // Update size counter
    }
  }
  
  // Add any remaining data as final chunk
  if (currentChunk.length > 0) {
    chunks.push(currentChunk);
  }
  
  return chunks;
}










What is yield?
yield is like a "pause and return" statement in a generator function
It allows the function to return a value and pause execution
When called again, it continues from where it left off
It's useful for handling large amounts of data without loading everything into memory at once

Generator Function:
The * makes this a generator function
Generator functions can pause and resume their execution
They use yield to return values one at a time
They maintain their state between yields







getRowSize doesn't count the number of rows. Instead, it calculates the size (in bytes) of a single row when converted to a string





Takes a single row (which is an object)
Converts it to a JSON string using JSON.stringify()
Returns the length of that string in bytes
This is used in the chunking process to ensure each chunk stays under the size limit:

      // currentChunk might look like this:
      // [
      //   { id: 1, name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" },
      //   { id: 2, name: "Jane", age: 25, city: "Boston" }
      // ]

current chunk stores the rows as object like basically array of object.

      // Start new chunk with current row if the previous chunk causes the rows to split.

      // Example chunkData might look like:
      // {
      //   tableName: "users",
      //   sampleData: [
      //     { id: 1, name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" },
      //     { id: 2, name: "Jane", age: 25, city: "Boston" }
      //   ]
      // }
the rows are never split,if the chunk size exceeds,then we will start from the same row where we concluded the prvious row to maintai the context.

the chunk data ensures all the rows for a given able is compiled.

  in tabledata passed to chunktablesdata,we are passing it as array of object where each object is a row
// Example table.data format
table.data = [
  { id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@example.com" },
  { id: 2, name: "Jane", email: "jane@example.com" },
  { id: 3, name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }

The chunkTableData function is using a simpler, byte-based chunking approach rather than token-based chunking

While it's true that tokens would be more accurate for language model contexts, this function appears to be designed for a simpler use case where:
Exact token counts aren't critical
Performance is important (JSON.stringify is faster than token counting)
The chunking is more approximate/conservative

This token-based version would be more accurate for language model contexts, but it would also be slower due to the token counting overhead. The original byte-based version is a reasonable compromise if exact token counts aren't critical and you want better performance.
